# Hands-on introduction to leveraging containers in research code

A hands-on introduction to containers using Docker with emphasis on supporting and sharing reproducible research software.

Develop as a 3-hour workshop for [ResBaz 2024](https://resbaz.auckland.ac.nz).

## Description

Have you ever find yourself with a potpourri of python versions lingering in your laptop, conflicting between them or drowning you in dependency hell? Maybe R, JavaScript, or other niche software? Have you ever find yourself trying to use custom software from a colleague or the inter-webs, only to find it is more difficult to install it than to run it? Or, have to try to share your code with lab mates, and they just cannot run without you? Have you ever find yourself running into reproducibility issues in those scenarios, or even with your own software some years later?

This session will introduce you to containers, using Docker, to help you create, maintain, share and consume code for your research in a manner that promotes reproducibility and provenance. And hopefully alleviate some of those pain points with research software.

This is a hands-on session and requires a minimum knowledge of Linux shell terminal, i.e. launching commands, listing and editing files or changing directories.

## Setup instructions

We will provide access to a Linux VM for the duration of the session, which you will access through your browser. You can also use your own computer with Docker pre-installed. Note that we will not be able to help you install Docker during the session (see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ for installation instructions).
